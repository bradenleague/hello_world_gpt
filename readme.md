# Project Name

Brief description of your project here.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Setup

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

python -m venv env

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

- On Windows:
  ```
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

pip install openai python-dotenv


## Configuring Environment Variables

To securely manage your application's configuration (e.g., API keys), you will use environment variables. This project uses the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

1. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.**

2. **Add your environment variables to the `.env` file.**

For example, to set the OpenAI API key, add the following line to your `.env` file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. **Loading environment variables in your application**

At the beginning of your main script, add the following lines to load the environment variables:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file.

openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
